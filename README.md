An Ansible role for performing safe [Elasticsearch rolling restarts](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_rolling_restarts.html), without the cluster ever getting red.

Requirements
------------

The task is using the `shell` module to perform `curl` requests to the local elasticsearch instance.

Role Variables
--------------

````yaml
es_http_port: 9200
es_service_name: elasticsearch
````

Dependencies
------------

The `elasticsearch-restart` role does not require any external dependencies.

Example Playbook
----------------

````yaml
---
- hosts : "elasticsearch_cluster"
  serial: 1
  roles:
    - elasticsearch-restart
````

While you can simply use the `elasticsearch-restart` role like shown in the snippet above, you likely want to perform some other operations on each node before actually starting the controlled restart. To do so, you can user this role within a playbook that also takes care of pre- and post- tasks like registering and deregistering the node from monitoring and from any load balancers you might be using. Please refer to the [Ansible documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/guide_rolling_upgrade.html) for further details.

````yaml
---

- hosts : "elasticsearch_cluster"
  serial: 1
  pre_tasks:
    - include: monitoring_deregister.yml
    - include: balancer_deregister.yml
  roles:
    - elasticsearch-restart
  post_tasks:
    - include: balancer_register.yml
    - include: monitoring_register.yml
````
